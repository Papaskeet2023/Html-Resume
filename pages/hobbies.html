<p>
    Jiu Jitsu is one of my foremost hobbies. I have been practicing for over 10 years. A feew years back I received my black belt in Kenpo Jiu Jitsu. In the picture is myself(on the right) and my good friend and partner, Nick.

<h2>Billards</h2>
<p>
    I have been taking part in billards for as long as I can remember. I have been a part of many tournaments, although I prefer to play alone. Billards teaches you to make the most of any situation you may find yourself in.

        I have been attending music festivals for many years. Me and my brother camp on site at the festivals. I have seen over 1,000+ bands.
