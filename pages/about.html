<p>
    My name is Pete Briant. I am currently building swimming pools and getting ready to open my own company. This has led me to getting back into Web Development. I cannot phatom the thought of someone else building my website for my business.
</p>
<p>
    All the jobs and adventures I have taken part in, I believe this is what makes a well rounded Web Developer. Every job I faced obstacles at some point or another. You learn to think and manuever around things and push through others. All my leadership skills and different personas of employees has built a toolbox of skills to be able to communicate with the client to the employer with no ripples. My years of remodeling homes, I had to design and carry out those designs with the homeowners. You learn to listen to detail and develop a sense of what they are visioning but cant describe fully through words. This is an priceless trait when it comes to designing and building a website. 
    <p>I took a pause in my Web Development for many years due to haviung a family to support(five boys and one girl). Now as I am embarking upon another business venture in my near future, my need to learn the fundamentals of today are of upmost importance.
