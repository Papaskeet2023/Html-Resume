<h2>Leadership</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Managed teams of 20+ employees</li>
    <li>Created schedules</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Over the years and throughout projects, I have been in many leadership roles. From running teams to running complete projects, I have adapted the ability to get things done in an timely and orderly fashion while never sacrificing employee moral.
</p>
<h2>Adaptability</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Multipble fields of employment</li>
    <li>Multiple areas of focus</li>
    <li>Multiple states of residence</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Having held many different fields of employment in various cities throughout the Southeast, I believe this is an integral part of being a highly versatile person. You are forced to continously be pushed outside of your safe box and adapt to the environment you are placed in. This is where working under pressure or high stress situations are of no challenge.
